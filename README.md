# Line-Follower-Robot-Using-IR-Sensor
The Line Follower Robot is a robotic system designed to follow a line on the ground using a Sharp IR sensor and an LN289N motor driver. The robot uses the IR sensor to detect the contrast between the line and the surface, allowing it to stay on the designated path.
